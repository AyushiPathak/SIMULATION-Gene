# SIMULATION-Gene
This is an open application made to reverse simulate the genomic data. The application has several population models that can be generated as per choice of different parameters. 
The application is made under project work of BINP29, Lund University, Sweden and is yet under progress. 
The modifications might include integrations of more models and work on the accuracy os some of existing models.
R-programming was used to dvelop the script and R-shiny was used to create the dashbord for the website.
